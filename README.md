# battleship v0.5
a tkinter(-table) based program that (soon) lets you play battleship using a distributed ledger (IOTA Tangle) as its data transfer backend

This current build (0.5) of battleship does not yet support true multiplayer but rather functions as a code example of how to transfer data to the IOTA network as well as fetching data from it based on the initial address of the transaction, decoding trytes back into intelligible binary / ASCII and passing it to tkintertable.

Future builds will attempt to allow two players to exchange each others addresses in order to be able to play against one another.
